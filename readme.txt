jQuery: didnt use
node: 14.17.0
express: 4.17.1
mongodb: 4.1.4
react: 17.0.2

npm i to install dependencies
node resetdb.js to reset the database
npm run client to run the react frontend
npm run server to run the backend express server
after all server started go to localhost:3000
as I am using mongodb atlas there is no data folder according to moodle

Should be all done unless I neglect some possible misbehaviour.
If somehow a button has no response then it goes to catch error part. Please reset the database and just check that part again :(
Not a design person I hope this simple design can get all the marks.
When it is on mobile the sidenav will hide by default and clicking the â‰¡ button it will display
For responsive I only tested with default client cases on Chrome(e.g. Moto G4, Galaxy S5) and I assume there is no extreme cases (e.g. width<320)
